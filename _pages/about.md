My name is Giovanni Jana, and I am a masters student in the [Chandra Family Department of Electrial and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). I am in the Architecture, Computer Systems, and Embedded Systems track. My area of interest is computer architecture, specifically performance modeling and high performance design. Currently I work as a GRA (Graduate Research Assistant) at [ARL:UT](https://www.arlut.utexas.edu/) developing high frequency sonar systems for underwater communications.

After graduate school, I intend to pursue a position in performance analysis and modeling for high performance computer architectures. Currently I am looking for opportunities to intern (or co-op) in related positions to help build my experience and knowledge base. 

Before Graduate School
======
Before attending UT, I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Engineering from the [University of South Florida](https://www.usf.edu/engineering/cse/). As a student I worked for the network operations department as a student asistant, as well as for the honors college as a student developer. I also did undergraduate research on FPGA Bitsream security under [Dr. Robert Karam](https://cse.usf.edu/~rkaram/) in the Interface Research Lab.
